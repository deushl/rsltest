Some nice custom animations, similar to jQuery UI Effects but works standalone.

Available effects:

- `flash` - Fades the element in and out
- `wiggle` - Shakes the element from left to right and vice versa
- `zap` - "Zooms" the element in or out (like if the TV-shuts down)

- `fadeToToggle` - Extended `fadeTo` function, to toggle the fadeTo value
- `slideFadeToggle` - Toggles the height and opacity at once (nothing special)

- `blowToggle` - Blows the element in or out
- `blowIn` - Blows the element in
- `blowOut` - Blows the element out

- `blindTopToggle` - Moves the element from the top in our out
- `blindtopIn` - Moves the element from the top in
- `blindTopOut` - Moves the element to the top out

- `blindRightToggle` - Moves the element from the right in our out
- `blindRightIn` - Moves the element from the right in
- `blindRightOut` - Moves the element to the right out

- `blindBottomToggle` - Moves the element from the bottom in our out
- `blindBottomIn` - Moves the element from the bottom in
- `blindBottomOut` - Moves the element to the bottom out
